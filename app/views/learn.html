  <h1 class="title">What is Lelylan Types</h1>

  <div class="description">

    <p>
    Lelylan Types is a place where you can define and discuss the structure of any device type
    like lights, locks, cameras, sensors and more. Why? Because to create an open connected home
    where everything communicates we need an open and clear way to define how these devices work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now we have dozens of standards: Wifi, Zigbee, Ethernet, Konnex, X10 to name some.
      If you want to let every device communicate between each other you will have hard time. This
      is one of the reasons why the connected home is not yet a reality. Our solution to this
      problem is to create a type, which defines a device structure in a unique way through the
      combination of three key elements:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Properties - what vary during time in a device.</li>
      <li>Functions - what a device can do.</li>
      <li>Statuses - what a device is in a specific moment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Follows a simple example describing a basic light.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Property <code>status</code> accepting values <code>on</code> and <code>off</code>.</li>
      <li>Functions <code>turn on</code> and <code>turn off</code>.</li>
      <li>Statuses <code>light on</code> and <code>light off</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    The definition of a type requires time to reach a stable version. If you like this project,
